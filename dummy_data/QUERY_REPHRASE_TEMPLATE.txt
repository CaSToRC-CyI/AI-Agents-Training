### TASK
    Rewrite the user's query while keeping its meaning and key terms intact.
    If the conversation history is empty, DO NOT change the query.
    Use conversation history only if necessary, and avoid extending the query with your own knowledge.
    If no changes are needed, output the current question as is.

    Conversation history:
    {% for memory in memories %}
        {{ memory.text }}
    {% endfor %}

    User Query: {{query}}
