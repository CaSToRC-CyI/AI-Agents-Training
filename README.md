# AI Agents Training

This repository supports the **Agentic AI: Core Concepts, Architectures, and Best Practices** workshop. It provides materials and hands-on exercises for learning how to design and build AI agents and RAG systems using modern frameworks like CrewAI and AutoGen.

## ðŸ§  Workshop Overview

### 1. Agentic AI: Concepts & Architectures
- Overview of reactive, deliberative, and cognitive agents
- LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS)
- Design patterns and real-world applications
- Human-AI collaboration and ethical design

### 2. Hands-On: Building with CrewAI & AutoGen
- Define agents, tools, memory, and plans
- Real-world best practices
- Guided multi-agent examples
- Requires an OpenAI API key (optional to follow along)

### 3. Hands-On: Introduction to RAG Systems
- Fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Explore 3â€“4 Jupyter notebooks with increasing complexity
- No coding required â€” parameterized, interactive exploration
- Learn retriever tuning, reranking, and prompt optimization

## ðŸ”‘ Requirements
- OpenAI API key (for full interactivity)
- Google Account

This repo is designed to help you **understand, build, and experiment** with LLM-based autonomous agents and retrieval-augmented systems.
