sun-god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was constructed to celebrate the successful defence of Rhodes city against an attack by Demetrius Poliorcetes, who had besieged it for a year with a large army and navy.\n","According to most contemporary descriptions, the Colossus stood approximately 70 cubits, or 33 metres (108 feet) high – approximately the height of the modern Statue of Liberty from feet to crown – making it the tallest statue in the ancient world.[2] It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC, although parts of it were preserved. In accordance with a certain oracle, the Rhodians did not build it again.[3] John Malalas wrote that Hadrian in his reign re-erected the Colossus,[4] but he was mistaken.[5] According to the Suda, the Rhodians were called Colossaeans (Κολοσσαεῖς), because they erected the statue on the island.\n","Meta: {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes', '_split_id': 0}\n","\n","\n","Document idx 1\n","\n","Content: [6]\n","In 653, an Arab force under Muslim general Muawiyah I conquered Rhodes, and according to the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor,[7] the statue was completely destroyed and the remains sold;[8] this account may be unreliable.[9]\n","Since 2008, a series of as-yet-unrealized proposals to build a new Colossus at Rhodes Harbour have been announced, although the actual location of the original monument remains in dispute.[10][11]\n","\n","Siege of Rhodes[edit]\n","Main article: Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC)\n","In the early fourth century BC, Rhodes, allied with Ptolemy I of Egypt, prevented a mass invasion staged by their common enemy, Antigonus I Monophthalmus.\n","In 304 BC a relief force of ships sent by Ptolemy arrived, and Demetrius (son of Antigonus) and his army abandoned the siege, leaving behind most of their siege equipment. To celebrate their victory, the Rhodians sold the equipment left behind for 300 talents[12] and decided to use the money to build a colossal statue of their patron god, Helios. Construction was left to the direction of Chares, a native of Lindos in Rhodes, who had been involved with large-scale statues before. His teacher, the sculptor Lysippos, had constructed a 22-metre-high (72-foot)[13] bronze statue of Zeus at Tarentum.\n","\n","\n","Meta: {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_of_Rhodes', '_split_id': 1}\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore\n","\n","document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()"],"metadata":{"id":"1AlEcKmCpKGw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753079812662,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Marios Constantinou","userId":"08118670076332792273"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["doc_embedder = OpenAIDocumentEmbedder()"],"metadata":{"id":"ygjqcmUWNNbW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753079812831,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":159,"user":{"displayName":"Marios Constantinou","userId":"08118670076332792273"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["docs_with_embeddings = doc_embedder.run(docs)\n","document_store.write_documents(docs_with_embeddings[\"documents\"])\n","print(f\"Stored {len(docs_with_embeddings['documents'])} documents with embeddings in the document store.\")"],"metadata":{"id":"6PzhXdYlNPMf","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753079816038,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3197,"user":{"displayName":"Marios Constantinou","userId":"08118670076332792273"}},"outputId":"7c35e281-c1a3-48e2-fb9e-b74885c5f492"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Calculating embeddings: 5it [00:03,  1.58it/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Stored 151 documents with embeddings in the document store.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["template = [\n","    ChatMessage.from_user(\n","        \"\"\"\n","Given the following information, answer the question.\n","\n","Context:\n","{% for document in documents %}\n","    {{ document.content }}\n","{% endfor %}\n","\n","Question: {{question}}\n","Answer:\n","\"\"\"\n","    )\n","]\n","\n","prompt_builder = ChatPromptBuilder(template=template)"],"metadata":{"id":"zXe8Du2HNQaM","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753079816059,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Marios Constantinou","userId":"08118670076332792273"}},"outputId":"2a431c63-2ca5-4cc0-bc98-42db16c803ed"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:haystack.components.builders.chat_prompt_builder:ChatPromptBuilder has 2 prompt variables, but `required_variables` is not set.
